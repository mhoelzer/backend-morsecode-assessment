# Morse Code decoder
This is a test framework (and solution) for working on the Morse Code katas 1 and 2 from Codewars:
https://www.codewars.com/kata/decode-the-morse-code-advanced/python

# How to Make the Magic Happen:

1. Enter `python test_morse.py` in the terminal.
- This runs the test stuff and the functions from the `main.py`.
2. Celebrate! :)
